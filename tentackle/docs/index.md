# Introduction

When it comes to backend web development, Java shines with its huge ecosystem.
A variety of application frameworks exist for almost any kind of requirement, 
architectural style and pattern. Following the public media,
one could get the impression, that everything is related to the web
somehow. This may indeed be true for the vast majority of Java projects,
but a small niche of non-web applications still exists in secret, mainly in the
technical or scientific domain.
